\hspace*{1cm}Implemented hierarchical graph model supports efficient optimal path retrieval. By extending the encoded path view to the hierarchical graph model, we achieve an excellent compromise between the complete computations of paths on-demand versus precomputing all paths. Path retrieval is still significantly faster than A*. In addition, the memory requirement of HEPV is also much less compared to FEPV.\\

\textbf{The contributions of our project can be summarized as follows:}\\
 \hspace*{1cm}1.	Implemented hierarchical graph model (HEPV) exploits path materialization strategies.\\
 \hspace*{1cm}2.	These algorithms are used to create and maintain HEPV.\\
 \hspace*{1cm}3.	Implemented a shortest path retrieval algorithm which can be shown to be optimal.\\
