	Efficient path query processing is a key requirement for advanced database applications including GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems). We study the problem in the context of automobile navigation systems where a large number of path requests can be submitted over the transportation network within a short period of time. To guarantee efficient response for path queries, we employ a path view materialization strategy for precomputing the best paths. We tackle the following three issues: (1) memory-resident solutions quickly exceed current computer storage capacity for networks of thousands of nodes, (2) disk based solutions have been found inefficient to meet the stringent performance requirements, and (3) path views become too costly to update for large graphs. Proposed HEPV(Hierarchical Encoded Path View) approach addresses these problems while guaranteeing the optimality of path retrieval.
